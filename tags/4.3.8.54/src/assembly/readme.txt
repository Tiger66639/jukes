2. Features
   --------
    *  Cross platform - works on Linux, Solaris, MacOSX, Windows.
    * Full support of ID3 v2.4 MP3 tags.
    * Full support of MP3, OGG Vorbis, FLAC, Monkey Audio APE, and SPEEX
    * Automatic creation of database if not found. No more proprietary use of MS Access.
    * Ability to display/sort your discs and tracks anyway you want. Lets you order discs by year, bitrate, name etc. Tracks by track number, or bitrate, or alphabetically.
    * Highlights any disc or tracks added within the last XX days. This allows new editions to stand out in large collections.
    * Filter by Genre, Years, Bitrates and most recently added albums
    * Disc Cleaner to remove discs that no longer exist in storage from the database. Useful for people that use IPods or Archos Jukeboxes as their storage.
    * Inline editing of artists, discs, tracks rather than the old click to open a new window metaphor.
    * Ability to import and export preferences.
    * File renaming based on a user defined regular expression. So you can name your files 01-Track1.mp3 or 01 - Track1 - 128kbps.mp3 or Track1 - 01.mp3
    * Web Search to retrieve disc cover, year, track names, and artist and disc name using Amazon.com Web Service.
    * Advanced search to find tracks. Fuzzy text search as well as by year, genre, bitrate.
    * Ability to export search results as CSV files for ad-hoc reporting.
    * WINDOWS ONLY: Tray icon for easy access, single click pause/play, mouse wheel click to advance next song.
    * WINDOWS ONLY: Ability to listen to Intellitype commands Pause Play Stop found on newer keyboards.
    * WINDOWS ONLY: Window+J key combination shows/hides the Jukes no matter where you are in Windows using global Hotkey
    * History is kept for a session so all songs played during a session can be saved as a playlist.
    * Correct title casing. Old Jukes: Can'T Get To 5Th Street. New Jukes: Can't Get To 5th Street
    * Playlists can be saved as Winamp .m3u files.
    * Playlists can be saved as XSPF playlist as described here: xspf.org
    * When more than one image is found per album the largest image is selected.
    * Forced artist/album directory structure no longer applies. Jukes recursively looks below all subdirectories looking for folders than contain music files.
    * When searching in the treeview the search no wraps unlike the old Jukes.
    * Any album image can be clicked on to take you to the album. Mousewheel click on album cover queues that album.
    * Album cover displays can be sized according to your taste or monitor size.
    * Database backup tool for compacting and zipping up your database.
    * Global Location Change tool for updating your database if you move your collection from c:\music to d:\music or anywhere else.
