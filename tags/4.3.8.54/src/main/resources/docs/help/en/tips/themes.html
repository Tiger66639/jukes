If you use the tool with the Plastic look, you can choose
a color theme in the <i>Preferences</i>.

<p>
Most themes have a prefix for the background color:
<i>Desert</i> is brown and works well on Windows ME/2000, 
<i>Sky</i> is light gray and works well on most platforms, and
<i>Experience</i> has been optimized for Windows XP.

<p>
The theme's suffix is for the foreground color and saturation, 
where <i>Bluer</i> is more saturated than <i>Blue</i>.
