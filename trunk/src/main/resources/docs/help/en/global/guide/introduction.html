      their entire CD collection to their hard drive. Jukes 4.0
      allows you to have all of your CD's at your fingertips and play
      them like a real jukebox. Perfect for DJ's, whether in your house
      or for parties or whatever, spin all of your favorite tunes
      anytime you want. No more loading the files in to play them and
      removing them to add more to the list, now all of your CD's are
